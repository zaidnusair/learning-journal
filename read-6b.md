# How computers work


## What makes a computer, a computer?

a computer is a **thinking machine**. any machine that does these 4 steps is considered a computer:
1. input
2. storage
3. process
4. output



## Binary and Data

* **Binary** number system is represented with *ones and zeros* only, unlike the decimal system thats represented with 0-9. these 1's and 0's can be considered **on** and **off** using electricity in wires, and the info carried inside them is called **bits**. all the information that is stored in a computer is using theis system.

* **text** are represented the same way by assigning a number to each alphabet and you can get words by combining these numbers.

* as for **graphics**; they are made out of pixels, these pixels are made out of combining different levels of red, blue and green. you can represent these levels using numbers.

* **sounds** are a series of vibrations and can be represented by a waveform, and any point on the wav form can be represented with a number.


## Circuits and Logic

* to process the information that comes in as input and to make the information thats output, a computer need to modify and combine the input signals. this is done using circuits.
* using logic gates; you can do simple logical calculations to that data to modify and combine them. by conicting these circuits together you can do more complex calculations.
* the info travelling through the wires in circuits are travelling with speed of light, and modern day circuits are fast because they are small and the information has less distance to travell.


## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

* the information the is **input** on a computer can be any kind, once it gets, in the computer stores it in **memory**. then the **CPU** *-central processing unit-* does the necessary calculation, and then it goes out as **output** which can also be of any kind.



## Hardware and Software

*  **hardware** is any physical part in a computer.
* **software** software is all the computer programs or code running on the machine.
* the **CPU** is what handels everything on the computer. it uses simple commands to tell the computer what to do, and when to use or not use certine circuits.
* **operating system** is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
