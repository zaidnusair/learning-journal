## how to specify color

**color terminology**

you use color to bring life into your page. 

You have 3 ways to specify colors:
1. color name: *darkgreen*
2. hex code: *#ee3e80*
3. rgb value:*rgb(100,100,90)*

**the main 3 colors are*red, green and blue**, and the rest is a combanation between them.


## contrast and readability 
contrast is the  important for text to be easy to red and comfortable for the eyes.
* *low contrast* is hard to read.
* *medium contrast* is comfortable for long reads.
* *high contrast* is clear and easy to read, but too much contrast can make is hard.


## background colors

**css** treats **HTML** elements as if they apear in a box, this is the color of that box.
it is also so specified by *name*,*hex*,*rgb*, if it wasn't specified it will be transperant. the defult background for browsers is white.

## CSS3 

#### opacity

it is the transperancey of an object, *CSS3* has it. its comes in values between (0-1), it was added to *rgba*; the letter **a** stands for **alpha* which indicates opacity.

#### HSL color

a new way to specify color using **HUE,saturation, lightness**. you can use the codes **hsl,hsla** (**a** stands for alpha to specify opasity) in CSS3 to use the *HSL* to specify color.

* **HUE** is expressed as an angle (0-360).
* **saturations** is expressed as a pecentage %.
* **lightness** is expressed as a pecentage % too, 0% for *white* and 100% for *black*
