# operators and loops


#### evalualting conditions

* you use evaluation to compaire a value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result is **true** or **false**.
* " == " *is equal to*, used for compairing two values to see if they're the same.
* " != " *is not equal to*, used for compairing two values to see if they're **not** the same.
* " === " *strict equal to*, used for compairing two values to check if both **data and type** are the same.
* " !== " *strict not equal to*, used for compairing two values to check if both **data and type** are **not** the same.
* " > " *greater than*, used to check if the number on the left is **greater** than the number on the right.
* " < " *less than*, used to check if the number on the left is **less** than the number on the right.
** you can use ">=" and "<=" to include the number on  the right.


#### logical operators

* allows you to compare the results of more than one comparision operator.
* " && " *logical AND*, tests more than one condition, if **both are true** it *return true*.
* " || " *logical OR*, tests at least one condition, if **one is true** it *return true*.
* " ! " *logical NOT*, *inverts* a single *boolean* value.


#### loops

* loops check a condition, if the return is true, it runs a code block.
* the condition keeps checking, as long as the return true the block will keep running, until it returns false, it will exit the block.
* loop types:
 ** FOR: runs a code a specific number of times. uses a counter.
 ** WHILE: used when you dont know the number of times it need to run. doesnt need a counter.
