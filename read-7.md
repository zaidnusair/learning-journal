### introduction
#### what is a script ?
a script is much like a recipe, its a series of instruction that a computer follows to achieve a goal.


#### how to write a script?
1. define the goal.

2. design the script.
  ** break each task into a sequance of steps. sketch the design using a flowchart.

3. code each step.
  ** computers dont approach tasks like humans. instructions must let thecomputer solve the tasl programmatically.


### expressions:
expressions evaluate into a single value.

types of expressions:

1. assign value to a variable. "var color = 'blue';"
2. usetwo or more values to return a single value. "var area = 5*3" 


### operators:
expressions rely on operators; they allow creating a single value from one or more values.

#### arithmetic operators:

#insert image

 order of excution: 
* multiplication and devision will be performed before addition and substraction.
* you can use parenthasis if you want to change the order of excution.

#### string operators: 

* there is only one string operator you can use; the addition "+". its used to join strings together (concatenation). if you try any other operation the result will be "not a number" (NaN).
* mixing numbers and strings together:
** you can add a number (place in quotes) to a string, the result will be the number becoming part of a string.

### Functions:
* functions let you group a series of statments together to perform a specific task. they are re-usable.
* functions arnt always excuted when the page loads. they are excuted when you want them to perform thier task (called).
* the steps inside the function are placed inside **blocks** (curly braces).
* peaces of information given to the function to start inside the parenthasis are knows as *parameters*. functions can be anonymous, they cant be *called* but they will execute when the interpeter comes across them.
* the response is called a **return value**.
* the function acts like a store, it holds statements until you're ready to use them.
* when calling a function that has parameters, you specify its values, these values are called *arguments* and they can be **values or variables**.
* the **return** key word is used to return value to the code that called the function
