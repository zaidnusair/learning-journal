# structuring web pages using HTML

**html** is a cading language that gives the bone structure of the website.
**css** is a used to make the bone structure look good and cover it with designs and colors and picture and other. 

## The process
for any website you the first thing you need to know is how the webpages are going to apear, meaning the design of the webpages.
You decide that by knowing your *targeted audience*, and what is their goal when visiting.
After you figure that out, you can use a **site map** to organize information into sections or pages. Then you can start with sketching the **wireframe** of your website to show the key information that you needs to go on each page of the website. it shows the hierarchy and spacing of the information.


## the design
you can get your message across by emplimenting the content in your webpages in an organized way that lets the viwer precieve it in the priority you would like them to.
you can direct the viwers attention to your main message through using **visual hierarchies** to guide them through navegating your website, you can do that by implementing the use of size, color, and style. you can also use images.
the **grouping** of the content helps keep related topics together to help the viewr with finding the information they need, they need to be consistant; because **similarity** helps the viewer navigate when skimming the pages.
