# Markdown 
[GiftHub](http://gifthub.com) is a site where you can build your own website without the need for data bases or servers and in many cases no HTML. Instead it uses _Markdown_.

**Markdown** is a way of styling texts, it is mostly a regular text with some non-alphabate characters.

### How to use it?
1. Simply, open a new **repo**.
2. Start typing like you're using *microsoft word*. 
3. Start *styling* __!__
   * to style it you can go to [GitHub Markdown Syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to see the kind of stuff you can do with it.

4. you can also add **images** ![image](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/280000/velka/not-found-image-15383864787lu.jpg)

   * to *resize* the image you can use this format:
      ```
      <img src="imagelink" width=0000>
      ```
    
      
   <img src="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/280000/velka/not-found-image-15383864787lu.jpg" width=100>
