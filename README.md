Hello, my name is *Zaid Nusair* and this is my view on the **growth mindset** written in *markdown* as an assignment.

# Growth mindset


### Well lets start with a question; why would you want to have a growth mindset?

You can come up with a million different reasons for that and this is what should be expected, but to actually live with that kind of mindset is harder than it sounds.
You see, growth fundamentally means change. And guess what people don't like, *change!* 

### It makes total sense when you think about it; why would you want to change?

To change is to step out of your comfort zone, even if that zone is literally hell on earth, at least your familiar with your hell, why would you dare to step into the unknown?!

An answer to that might be; "because that is life". According to Buddhism; *life **is** suffering*. This statement changed me, happiness is not the default state of life nor is easy, and we're all just trying to survive it.
And to survive you'll need tools and those tools should be constantly sharpened. Your best tool is your mind, and how can you sharpen that tool? By learning! Weather it is a new skill or a new language or even a new concept, its all new information that you can use as tools of survival. and sometimes you learn something so powerful that it changes something in you, it can be through life experiences, like the death of a relative or the betrayal of a loved one. You're not the same after an event like that, it will pass and you will emerge a new person.

> To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small.                         -Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

Upon learning something new, Just like deadwood your ~~old self burn~~ and you're ***born again***. 

### How can you use the growth mindset?
Well, the hardest and most important part is getting started. If you did that, all thats left is to keep the momentum going. 
Always remember:

1. You miss 100% of the chances you don't take.
2. Everybody starts somewhere. 
3. There is always more to learn.
4. If something is challenging or difficult its a chance to learn and develop even more.
5. compare yourself to who you where yesterday not who someone else is today.

And even if it overwhelms you, once you do it; it will be that much more rewarding.
